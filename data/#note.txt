    - further processed batch information mainly employed in this work

    - sample size is greater than 30 in each batch

    - replicates is greater than 2 in each compound

    - filtered with the below data file

- HTHGU133A_selected.pkl, HTHGU133AEA_selected.pkl

    - preprocessed gene expression data derived from CMap database.

    - CEL files were obtained from CMap database and procssed by ReadAffy program in R

    - After removing probes with only NANs, probes were converted into genes using median

    - Then, data was filtered with the above batch file
